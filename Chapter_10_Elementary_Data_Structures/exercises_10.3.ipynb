Suppose further that of the $m$ items, exactly $n$ are on list $L$ and $m - n$ are on the free list. Write a procedure COMPACTIFY-LIST$(L,F)$ that, given the list $L$ and the free list $F$, moves the items in $L$ so that they occupy array positions $1,2,\\dots,n$ and adjusts the free list $F$ so that it remains correct, occupying array positions $n+1, n+2, \\dots ,m$.
