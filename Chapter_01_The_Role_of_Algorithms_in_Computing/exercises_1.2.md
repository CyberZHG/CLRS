## 1.2 Algorithm as a technology

### 1.2-1

> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

Drive navigation.

### 1.2-2

> Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $$n$$, insertion sort runs in $$8n^2$$ steps, while merge sort runs in $$64nlgn$$ steps. For which values of $$n$$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?

$$8n^2 < 64nlgn$$

$$2^n < n^8$$

$$n \le 43$$

### 1.2-3

> What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is $$100n^2$$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $$2^n$$ on the same machine?

$$100n^2 < 2^n$$

$$n \ge 15$$
