### 1.2 - 1

> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

### 1.2-2

> Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in $$8n^2$$ steps, while merge
sort runs in $$64nlgn$$ steps. For which values of $$n$$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?

### 1.2-3

> What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is $$00n^2$$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $$2n$$ on the same machine?
