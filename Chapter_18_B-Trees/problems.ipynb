    "### 18-1 Stacks on secondary storage\n",
    "\n",
    "> Consider implementing a stack in a computer that has a relatively small amount of fast primary memory and a relatively large amount of slower disk storage. The operations PUSH and POP work on single-word values. The stack we wish to support can grow to be much larger than can fit in memory, and thus most of it must be stored on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A simple, but inefficient, stack implementation keeps the entire stack on disk. We maintain in-memory a stack pointer, which is the disk address of the top element on the stack. If the pointer has value $p$, the top element is the $( p ~\\text{mod}~ m )$th word on page $\\lfloor p / m \\rfloor$ of the disk, where $m$ is the number of words per page.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To implement the PUSH operation, we increment the stack pointer, read the appropriate page into memory from disk, copy the element to be pushed to the appropriate word on the page, and write the page back to disk. A POP operation is similar. We decrement the stack pointer, read in the appropriate page from disk, and return the top of the stack. We need not write back the page, since it was not modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because disk operations are relatively expensive, we count two costs for any implementation: the total number of disk accesses and the total CPU time. Any disk access to a page of $m$ words incurs charges of one disk access and $\\Theta(m)$ CPU time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __*a*__. Asymptotically, what is the worst-case number of disk accesses for $n$ stack operations using this simple implementation? What is the CPU time for $n$ stack operations? (Express your answer in terms of $m$ and $n$ for this and subsequent parts.)"

If the relevant disk page is already in memory, then no disk accesses are required.\n",

    "### 18-2 Joining and splitting 2-3-4 trees\n",
    "\n",
    "> The __*join*__ operation takes two dynamic sets $S'$ and $S''$ and an element $x$ such that for any $x' \\in S'$ and $x'' \\in S''$, we have $x'.key < x.key < x''.key$. It returns a set $S = S' \\cup \\{x\\} \\cup S''$. The __*split*__ operation is like an \"inverse\" join: given a dynamic set $S$ and an element $x \\in S$, it creates a set $S'$ that consists of all elements in set $S$ and an element $x \\in S$, it creates a set $S'$ that consists of all elements in $S - \\{x\\}$ whose keys are less than $x.key$ and a set $S''$ that consists of all elements in $S - \\{x\\}$ whose keys are greater than $x.key$. In this problem, we investigate how to implement these operations on 2-3-4 trees. We assume for convenience that elements consist only of keys and that all key values are distinct.\n",

Show that $p$ breaks $S'$ into a set of trees $\\{T'_0, T'_1, \\dots, T'_m\\}$ and a set of keys $\\{k'_1, k'_2, \\dots, k'_m\\}$, where, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, m$, we have $y < k'_i < z$ for any keys $y \\in T'_{i-1}$ and $z \\in T'_i$.

Use the join operation to assemble the keys in $S'$ into a single 2-3-4 tree $T'$ and the keys in $S''$ into a single 2-3-4 tree $T''$. The running time of the split operation should be $O(\\lg n)$, where $n$ is then umber of keys in $T$. (Hint: The costs for joining should telescope.)"
