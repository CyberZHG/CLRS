    "> As stated, in dynamic programming we first solve the subproblems and then choose which of them to use in an optimal solution to the problem. Professor Capulet claims that we do not always need to solve all the subproblems in order to find an optimal solution. She suggests that we can find an optimal solution to the matrix-chain multiplication problem by always choosing the matrix $A_k$ at which to split the subproduct $A_iA_{i+1} \\cdots A_j$ (by selecting $k$ to minimize the quantity $p_{i-1}p_kp_j$) before solving the subproblems. Find an instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem for which this greedy approach yields a suboptimal solution."

    "> Imagine that you wish to exchange one currency for another. You realize that instead of directly exchanging one currency for another, you might be better off making a series of trades through other currencies, winding up with the currency you want. Suppose that you can trade $n$ different currencies, numbered $1,2,\\dots,n$, where you start with currency $1$ and wish to wind up with currency $n$. You are given, for each pair of currencies $i$ and $j$ , an exchange rate $r_{ij}$, meaning that if you start with $d$ units of currency $i$ , you can trade for $dr_{ij}$ units of currency $j$. A sequence of trades may entail a commission, which depends on the number of trades you make. Let $c_k$ be the commission that you are charged when you make $k$ trades. Show that, if $c_k = 0$ for all $k = 1,2, \\dots, n$, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ exhibits optimal substructure. Then show that if commissions $c_k$ are arbitrary values, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ does not necessarily exhibit optimal substructure."
