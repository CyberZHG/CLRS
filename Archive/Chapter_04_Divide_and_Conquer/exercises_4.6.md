## 4.6 Proof of the master theorem

### 4.6-1 $$\star$$

> Give a simple and exact expression for $$n_j$$ in equation (4.27) for the case in which b is a positive integer instead of an arbitrary real number.

$$
n_j=\left \lceil \frac{n}{b^j} \right \rceil
$$

### 4.6-2 $$\star$$

> Show that if $$f(n)=\Theta(n^{\log_ba}\lg^kn)$$, where $$k \ge 0$$, then the master recurrence has solution $$T(n)=\Theta(n^{\log_ba}\lg^{k+1}n)$$. For simplicity, confine your analysis to extract powers of $$b$$.

$$
\dots
$$

### 4.6-3 $$\star$$

> Show that case 3 of the master theorem is overstated, in the sense that the regularity condition $$af(n/b) \le cf(n)$$ for some constant $$c < 1$$ implies that there exists a constant $$\epsilon > 0$$ such that $$f(n)=\Omega(n^{\log_ba+\epsilon})$$.

$$
\dots
$$
