## 8.3 Radix sort

### 8.3-1

> Using Figure 8.3 as a model, illustrate the operation of RADIX-SORT on the following list of English words: COW, DOG, SEA, RUG, ROW, MOB, BOX, TAB, BAR, EAR, TAR, DIG, BIG, TEA, NOW, FOX.

### 8.3-2

> Which of the following sorting algorithms are stable: insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort? Give a simple scheme that makes any sorting algorithm stable. How much additional time and space does your scheme entail?

Stable: insertion sort, merge sort.

When two values are equals, compare the original index. Additional space: $$\Theta(n)$$


### 8.3-3

> Use induction to prove that radix sort works. Where does your proof need the assumption that the intermediate sort is stable?

$$\dots$$

### 8.3-4

> Show how to sort n integers in the range $$0$$ to $$n^3 - 1$$ in $$O(n)$$ time.

$$n$$-ary radix sort, including three $$O(n)$$ counting sort.

### 8.3-5 $$\star$$

> In the first card-sorting algorithm in this section, exactly how many sorting passes are needed to sort $$d$$-digit decimal numbers in the worst case? How many piles of cards would an operator need to keep track of in the worst case?

$$\Theta(k^d)$$ passes.

$$\Theta(nk)$$ piles.
