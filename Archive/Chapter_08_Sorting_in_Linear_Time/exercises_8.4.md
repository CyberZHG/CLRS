## 8.4 Bucket sort

### 8.4-1

> Using Figure 8.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of BUCKET-SORT on the array $$A = \left \langle.79, .13, .16, .64, .39, .20, .89, .53, .71, .42\right \rangle$$.

| R | |
|:-:|:--|
| 0 ||
| 1 |.13 .16|
| 2 |.20|
| 3 |.39|
| 4 |.42|
| 5 |.53|
| 6 |.64|
| 7 ||
| 8 |.79 .71|
| 9 |.89|

$$A = \left \langle.13, .16, .20, .39, .42, .53, .64, .71, .79, .89\right \rangle$$

### 8.4-2

> Explain why the worst-case running time for bucket sort is $$\Theta(n^2)$$. What simple change to the algorithm preserves its linear average-case running time and makes its worst-case running time $$O(n \lg n)$$?

Worst: all the elements falls in one bucket, $$\Theta(n ^ 2)$$ sorting.

Change: use merge sort in each bucket.

### 8.4-3

> Let $$X$$ be a random variable that is equal to the number of heads in two flips of a fair coin. What is $$\text{E}[X^2]$$? What is $$\text{E}^2[X]$$?

$$
\text{E}[X] = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1
$$

$$
\text{E}[X^2] = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1.5
$$

$$
\text{E}^2[X] = \text{E}[X] \cdot \text{E}[X] = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
$$

### 8.4-4 $$\star$$

> We are given $$n$$ points in the unit circle, $$p_i = (xi, yi)$$, such that $$0 < x_i^2 + y_i^2 \le 1$$ for $$i = 1,2, \dots ,n$$. Suppose that the points are uniformly distributed; that is, the probability of finding a point in any region of the circle is proportional to the area of that region. Design an algorithm with an average-case running time of $$\Theta(n)$$ to sort the $$n$$ points by their distances $$d_i = \sqrt{x_i^2+y_i^2}$$ from the origin. 

Bucket sort by radius, 

$$
\pi r_i^2 = \frac{i}{10} \cdot \pi 1^2
$$

$$
r_i = \sqrt{\frac{i}{10}}
$$

### 8.4-5 $$\star$$

> A __*probability distribution function*__ $$P(x)$$ for a random variable $$X$$ is defined by $$P(x) = \text{Pr}\{X \le x\}$$. Suppose that we draw a list of $$n$$ random variables $$X_1,X_2, \dots ,X_n$$ from a continuous probability distribution function $$P$$ that is computable in $$O(1)$$ time. Give an algorithm that sorts these numbers in linear average-case time.

Bucket sort by $$p_i$$,

$$
P(p_i) = \frac{i}{10}
$$
