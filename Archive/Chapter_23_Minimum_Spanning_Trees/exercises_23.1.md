## 23.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree

### 23.1-1

> Let $$(u, v)$$ be a minimum-weight edge in a connected graph $$G$$. Show that $$(u, v)$$ belongs to some minimum spanning tree of $$G$$.

$$S = {u}$$.

### 23.1-2

> Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem 23.1. Let $$G = (V, E)$$ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function $$w$$ defined on $$E$$. Let $$A$$ be a subset of $$E$$ that is included in some minimum spanning tree for $$G$$, let $$(S, V - S)$$ be any cut of $$G$$ that respects $$A$$, and let $$(u, v)$$ be a safe edge for $$A$$ crossing $$(S, V - S)$$. Then, $$(u, v)$$ is a light edge for the cut. Show that the professor's conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample.

Not light.

### 23.1-3

> Show that if an edge $$(u, v)$$ is contained in some minimum spanning tree, then it is a light edge crossing some cut of the graph.

$$(u, v)$$ is a bridge in the minimum spanning tree, thus $$V$$ can be divided into two components.

### 23.1-4

> Give a simple example of a connected graph such that the set of edges $$\{(u, v):$$ there exists a cut $$(S, V - S)$$ such that $$(u, v)$$ is a light edge crossing $$(S, V - S)\}$$ does not form a minimum spanning tree.

$$E = \{(u, v), (v, w), (w, u)\}$$ with the same weight.

### 23.1-5

> Let $$e$$ be a maximum-weight edge on some cycle of connected graph $$G = (V, E)$$. Prove that there is a minimum spanning tree of $$G' = (V, E - \{e\})$$ that is also a minimum spanning tree of $$G$$. That is, there is a minimum spanning tree of $$G$$ that does not include $$e$$.

The edges in the cycle are lighter than the maximum-weight edge.

### 23.1-6

> Show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if, for every cut of the graph, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Show that the converse is not true by giving a counterexample.

Counterexample: $$E = \{(u, v), (u, w)\}$$ with the same weight.

### 23.1-7

> Argue that if all edge weights of a graph are positive, then any subset of edges that connects all vertices and has minimum total weight must be a tree. Give an example to show that the same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be nonpositive.

Not a tree: remove one edge from the cycle.

Nonpositive: $$E = \{(u, v), (v, w), (w, u)\}$$ with the same weight -1.

### 23.1-8

> Let $$T$$ be a minimum spanning tree of a graph $$G$$, and let $$L$$ be the sorted list of the edge weights of $$T$$. Show that for any other minimum spanning tree $$T'$$ of $$G$$, the list $$L$$ is also the sorted list of edge weights of $$T'$$.

$$\dots$$

### 23.1-9

> Let $$T$$ be a minimum spanning tree of a graph $$G = (V, E)$$, and let $$V'$$ be a subset of $$V$$. Let $$T'$$ be the subgraph of $$T$$ induced by $$V'$$, and let $$G'$$ be the subgraph of $$G$$ induced by $$V'$$. Show that if $$T'$$ is connected, then $$T'$$ is a minimum spanning tree of $$G'$$.

Cut $$V'$$.

### 23.1-10

> Given a graph $$G$$ and a minimum spanning tree $$T$$, suppose that we decrease the weight of one of the edges in $$T$$. Show that $$T$$ is still a minimum spanning tree for $$G$$. More formally, let $$T$$ be a minimum spanning tree for $$G$$ with edge weights given by weight function $$w$$. Choose one edge $$(x, y) \in T$$ and a positive number $$k$$, and define the weight function $$w'$$ by

> $$
w'(u, v) = \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
w(u, v) & \text{if}~(u, v) \ne (x, y), \\
w(x, y) - k & \text{if}~(u, v) = (x, y).
\end{array}
\right .
$$

> Show that $$T$$ is a minimum spanning tree for $$G$$ with edge weights given by $$w'$$.

Lighter.

### 23.1-11 $$\star$$

> Given a graph $$G$$ and a minimum spanning tree $$T$$, suppose that we decrease the weight of one of the edges not in $$T$$. Give an algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree in the modified graph.

If the edge $$(u, v)$$ is not in $$T$$ and its weight is less than some edge in the path from $$u$$ to $$v$$, then replace the edge with maximum weight in the path with $$(u, v)$$.
