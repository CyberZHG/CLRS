## 11.4 Open addressing

### 11.4-1

> Consider inserting the keys $$10, 22, 31, 4, 15, 28, 17, 88, 59$$ into a hash table of length $$m = 11$$ using open addressing with the auxiliary hash function $$h'(k) = k$$. Illustrate the result of inserting these keys using linear probing, using quadratic probing with $$c_1 = 1$$ and $$c_2 = 3$$, and using double hashing with $$h_1(k) = k$$ and $$h_2(k) = 1 + (k ~\text{mod}~ (m - 1))$$.

```python
m = 11


class LinearProbing:
    def __init__(self):
        global m
        self.slots = [None for _ in xrange(m)]

    def insert(self, key):
        global m
        i = 0
        while True:
            pos = (key + i) % m
            if self.slots[pos] is None:
                break
            i += 1
        self.slots[pos] = key


class QuadraticProbing:
    def __init__(self):
        global m
        self.slots = [None for _ in xrange(m)]

    def insert(self, key):
        global m
        i = 0
        while True:
            pos = (key + i + 3 * i * i) % m
            if self.slots[pos] is None:
                break
            i += 1
        self.slots[pos] = key


class DoubleHashing:
    def __init__(self):
        global m
        self.slots = [None for _ in xrange(m)]

    def insert(self, key):
        global m
        i = 0
        h2 = 1 + (key % (m - 1))
        while True:
            pos = (key + i * h2) % m
            if self.slots[pos] is None:
                break
            i += 1
        self.slots[pos] = key
```

Linear: [22, 88, None, None, 4, 15, 28, 17, 59, 31, 10]

Quadratic: [22, None, 88, 17, 4, None, 28, 59, 15, 31, 10]

Double: [22, None, 59, 17, 4, 15, 28, 88, None, 31, 10]


### 11.4-2

> Write pseudocode for HASH-DELETE as outlined in the text, and modify HASHINSERT to handle the special value DELETED.

```python
m = 5


class LinearProbing:
    def __init__(self):
        global m
        self.slots = [None for _ in xrange(m)]

    def insert(self, key):
        global m
        i = 0
        while True:
            pos = (key + i) % m
            if self.slots[pos] is None or self.slots[pos] == '[Deleted]':
                break
            i += 1
        self.slots[pos] = key

    def delete(self, key):
        global m
        i = 0
        while True:
            pos = (key + i) % m
            if self.slots[pos] is None:
                break
            if self.slots[pos] == key:
                self.slots[pos] = '[Deleted]'
                break
            i += 1
```

### 11.4-3

> Consider an open-address hash table with uniform hashing. Give upper bounds on the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search and on the expected number of probes in a successful search when the load factor is 3/4 and when it is 7/8.

$$\alpha=3/4$$, unsuccessful: $$\displaystyle\frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{4}} = 4$$ probes, successful: $$\displaystyle \frac{1}{\frac{3}{4}} \ln \frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{4}} \approx 1.848$$ probes.

$$\alpha=7/8$$, unsuccessful: $$\displaystyle\frac{1}{1-\frac{7}{8}} = 8$$ probes, successful: $$\displaystyle \frac{1}{\frac{7}{8}} \ln \frac{1}{1-\frac{7}{8}} \approx 2.377$$ probes.

### 11.4-4 $$\star$$

> Suppose that we use double hashing to resolve collisionsâ€”that is, we use the hash function $$h(k, i) = (h_1(k) + ih_2(k)) ~\text{mod}~ m$$. Show that if $$m$$ and $$h_2(k)$$ have greatest common divisor $$d \ge 1$$ for some key $$k$$, then an unsuccessful search for key $$k$$ examines $$(1/d)$$th of the hash table before returning to slot $$h_1(k)$$. Thus, when $$d = 1$$, so that $$m$$ and $$h_2(k)$$ are relatively prime, the search may examine the entire hash table.

Suppose $$d = \gcd(m, h_2(k))$$, the LCM $$l = m \cdot h_2(k) / d$$.

Since $$d | h_2(k)$$, then $$m \cdot h_2(k) / d ~\text{mod}~ m = 0 \cdot (h_2(k) / d ~\text{mod}~ m) = 0$$, therefore $$(l + ih_2(k)) ~\text{mod}~ m = ih_2(k) ~\text{mod}~ m$$, which means $$ih_2(k) ~\text{mod}~ m$$ has a period of $$m/d$$.

### 11.4-5 $$\star$$

> Consider an open-address hash table with a load factor $$\alpha$$. Find the nonzero value $$\alpha$$ for which the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search equals twice the expected number of probes in a successful search. Use the upper bounds given by Theorems 11.6 and 11.8 for these expected numbers of probes.

$$
\frac{1}{1 - \alpha} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\alpha} \ln \frac{1}{1 - \alpha}
$$

$$
\alpha = 0.71533
