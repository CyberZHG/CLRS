## 16.4 Matroids and greedy methods

### 16.4-1

> Show that $$(S, I_k)$$ is a matroid, where $$S$$ is any finite set and $$I_k$$ is the set of all subsets of $$S$$ of size at most $$k$$, where $$k \le |S|$$.

### 16.4-2 $$\star$$

> Given an $$m \times n$$ matrix $$T$$ over some field (such as the reals), show that $$(S, I)$$ is a matroid, where $$S$$ is the set of columns of $$T$$ and $$A \in I$$ if and only if the columns in $$A$$ are linearly independent.

### 16.4-3 $$\star$$

> Show that if $$(S, I)$$ is a matroid, then $$(S, I')$$ is a matroid, where

> $$I' = \{ A': S - A'$$ contains some maximal $$A \in I \}$$.

> That is, the maximal independent sets of $$(S, I')$$ are just the complements of the maximal independent sets of $$(S, I)$$.

### 16.4-4 $$\star$$

> Let $$S$$ be a finite set and let $$S_1, S_2, \dots, S_k$$ be a partition of $$S$$ into nonempty disjoint subsets. Define the structure $$(S, I)$$ by the condition that $$I = \{ A : | A \cap S_i | \le 1$$ for $$i = 1, 2, \dots, k \}$$. Show that $$(S, I)$$ is a matroid. That is, the set of all sets $$A$$ that contain at most one member of each subset in the partition determines the independent sets of a matroid.

### 16.4-5

> Show how to transform the weight function of a weighted matroid problem, where the desired optimal solution is a _minimum-weight_ maximal independent subset, to make it a standard weighted-matroid problem. Argue carefully that your transformation is correct.
