## 24.4 Difference constraints and shortest paths

### 24.4-1

> Find a feasible solution or determine that no feasible solution exists for the following system of difference constraints:

### 24.4-2

> Find a feasible solution or determine that no feasible solution exists for the following system of difference constraints:

No solution.

### 24.4-3

> Can any shortest-path weight from the new vertex $$v_0$$ in a constraint graph be positive? Explain.

### 24.4-4

> Express the single-pair shortest-path problem as a linear program.

### 24.4-5

> Show how to modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm slightly so that when we use it to solve a system of difference constraints with m inequalities on n unknowns, the running time is $$O(nm)$$.

### 24.4-6

> Suppose that in addition to a system of difference constraints, we want to handle __equality constraints__ of the form $$x_i = x_j + b_k$$. Show how to adapt the Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve this variety of constraint system.

### 24.4-7

> Show how to solve a system of difference constraints by a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm that runs on a constraint graph without the extra vertex $$v_0$$.

### 24.4-8 $$\star$$

> Let $$Ax \le b$$ be a system of $$m$$ difference constraints in $$n$$ unknowns. Show that the Bellman-Ford algorithm, when run on the corresponding constraint graph, maximizes $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$ subject to $$Ax \le b$$ and $$x_i \le 0$$ for all $$x_i$$.

### 24.4-9 $$\star$$

> Show that the Bellman-Ford algorithm, when run on the constraint graph for a system $$Ax \le b$$ of difference constraints, minimizes the quantity $$(\max\{x_i\} - \min\{x_i\})$$ subject to $$Ax \le b$$. Explain how this fact might come in handy if the algorithm is used to schedule construction jobs.

### 24.4-10

> Suppose that every row in the matrix $$A$$ of a linear program $$Ax \le b$$ corresponds to a difference constraint, a single-variable constraint of the form $$x_i \le b_k$$, or a singlevariable constraint of the form $$-x_i \le b_k$$. Show how to adapt the Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve this variety of constraint system.

### 24.4-11

> Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system $$Ax \le b$$ of difference constraints when all of the elements of b are real-valued and all of the unknowns $$x_i$$ must be integers.

### 24.4-12 $$\star$$

> Give an efficient algorithm to solve a system $$Ax \le b$$ of difference constraints when all of the elements of b are real-valued and a specified subset of some, but not necessarily all, of the unknowns $$x_i$$ must be integers.
