## 24.1 The Bellman-Ford algorithm

### 24.1-1

> Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 24.4, using vertex $$z$$ as the source. In each pass, relax edges in the same order as in the figure, and show the $$d$$ and $$\pi$$ values after each pass. Now, change the weight of edge $$(z,x)$$ to 4 and run the algorithm again, using $$s$$ as the source.

| \ | $$s$$ | $$t$$ | $$x$$ | $$y$$ | $$z$$ |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|$$d$$|2|4|6|9|0|
|$$\pi$$|$$z$$|$$x$$|$$y$$|$$s$$|NIL|

| \ | $$s$$ | $$t$$ | $$x$$ | $$y$$ | $$z$$ |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|$$d$$|0|0|2|7|-2|
|$$\pi$$|NIL|$$x$$|$$z$$|$$s$$|$$t$$|

### 24.1-2

> Prove Corollary 24.3.

No path property.

### 24.1-3

> Given a weighted, directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ with no negative-weight cycles, let $$m$$ be the maximum over all vertices $$v \in V$$ of the minimum number of edges in a shortest path from the source $$s$$ to $$v$$. (Here, the shortest path is by weight, not the number of edges.) Suggest a simple change to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that allows it to terminate in $$m + 1$$ passes, even if $$m$$ is not known in advance.

Stop when no vertex is relaxed in a single loop.

### 24.1-4

> Modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm so that it sets $$v.d$$ to $$-\infty$$ for all vertices $$v$$ for which there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from the source to $$v$$.

```
if v.d > u.d + w(u, v)
     v.d = -inf
```

### 24.1-5 $$\star$$

> Let $$G = (V, E)$$ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function $$w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$. Give an $$O(VE)$$-time algorithm to find, for each vertex $$v \in V$$, the value $$\delta^*(v)=\min_{u \in V} \{ \delta(u, v) \}$$.

```
RELAX(u, v, w)
1 if v.d > min(w(u, v), w(u, v) + u.d)
2      v.d > min(w(u, v), w(u, v) + u.d)
3      v.pi = u.pi
```

### 24.1-6 $$\star$$

> Suppose that a weighted, directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ has a negative-weight cycle. Give an efficient algorithm to list the vertices of one such cycle. Prove that your algorithm is correct.

Based on exercise 24.1-4, DFS from a vertex $$u$$ that $$u.d = -\infty$$, if the weight sum on the search path is negative and the next vertex is BLACK, then the search path forms a negative-weight cycle.
