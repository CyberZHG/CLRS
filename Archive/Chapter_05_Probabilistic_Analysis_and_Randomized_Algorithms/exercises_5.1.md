## 5.1 The hiring problem

### 5.1-1

> Show that the assumption that we are always able to determine which candidate is best, in line 4 of procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT, implies that we know a total order on the ranks of the candidates.

Transitive


### 5.2-2 $$\star$$

> Describe an implementation of the procedure RANDOM$$(a, b)$$ that only makes calls to RANDOM$$(0, 1)$$. What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of $$a$$ and $$b$$?

Divide $$[a, b]$$ into $$[a, mid]$$ and $$(mid, b]$$, if RANDOM$$(0, 1)$$ gives 0 then we choose $$[a, mid]$$ and repeat the step until there is only one element left. The expected running time is $$\Theta(\lg(b-a))$$.

```python
import random


def random_interval(a, b):
    while a < b:
        if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
            b = (a + b) // 2
        else:
            a = (a + b) // 2 + 1
    return a
```

### 5.2-3 $$\star$$

> Suppose that you want to output $$0$$ with probability $$1/2$$ and $$1$$ with probability $$1/2$$. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either $$0$$ or $$1$$. It outputs $$1$$ with some probability $$p$$ and $$0$$ with probability $$1 - p$$, where $$0 < p < 1$$, but you do not know what $$p$$ is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning $$0$$ with probability $$1/2$$ and $$1$$ with probability $$1/2$$. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of $$p$$?

The probabilities of generating (0, 1) and (1, 0) with BIASED-RANDOM is the same. We can generate two numbers with BIASED-RANDOM, and if they are different, we can return the first number, otherwise we should regenerate the two numbers. Since the probability of generating two different number is $$2p(1-p)$$, thus the expectation of generation times is $$\frac{1}{2p(1-p)}$$.


```python
import random


def biased_random():
    if random.random() < 0.1:
        return 0
    return 1


def unbiased_random():
    while True:
        a = biased_random()
        b = biased_random()
        if a != b:
            return a
```
