## 31.3 Modular arithmetic

### 31.3-1

> Draw the group operation tables for the groups $$(\mathbb{Z}_4, +_4)$$ and $$(\mathbb{Z}_5^*, \cdot_5)$$. Show that these groups are isomorphic by exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence $$\alpha$$ between their elements such that $$a + b \equiv c ~(\text{mod}~4)$$ if and only if $$\alpha(a) \cdot \alpha(b) \equiv \alpha(c) ~(\text{mod}~5)$$.

* $$(\mathbb{Z}_4, +_4)$$: $$\{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}$$.
* $$(\mathbb{Z}_5^*, \cdot_5)$$: $$\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$$.

$$\alpha(x) = 2^{x-1}$$.

### 31.3-2

> List all subgroups of $$\mathbb{Z}_9$$ and of $$\mathbb{Z}_{13}^*$$.

* $$\mathbb{Z}_9$$
   * $$\langle 0 \rangle = \{ 0 \}$$,
   * $$\langle 1 \rangle = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \}$$,
   * $$\langle 2 \rangle = \{ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \}$$.
* $$\mathbb{Z}_{13}^*$$
   * $$\langle 1 \rangle = \{ 1 \}$$,
   * $$\langle 2 \rangle = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \}$$.

### 31.3-3

> Prove Theorem 31.14.

> A nonempty closed subset of a finite group is a subgroup.

* Closure: the subset is closed.
* Identity: suppose $$a \in S'$$, then $$a^{(k)} \in S'$$. Since the subset is finite, there must be a period such that $$a^{(m)} = a^{(n)}$$, hence $$a^{(m)}a^{(-n)} = a^{(m - n)} = 1$$, therefore the subset must contain the identity.
* Associativity: inherit from the origin group.
* Inverses: suppose $$a^{(k)} = 1$$, the inverse of element $$a$$ is $$a^{(k-1)}$$ since $$aa^{(k-1)}=a^{(k)}=1$$.

### 31.3-4

> Show that if $$p$$ is prime and $$e$$ is a positive integer, then

> $$\phi(p^e) = p^{e-1}(p - 1)$$.

$$\phi(p^e) = p^e \cdot \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right ) = p^{e-1}(p - 1)$$.

### 31.3-5

> Show that for any integer $$n > 1$$ and for any $$a \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$, the function $$f_a : \mathbb{Z}_n^* \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$ defined by $$f_a(x) = ax ~\text{mod}~ n$$ is a permutation of $$\mathbb{Z}_n^*$$.

To prove it is a permutation, we need to prove that 
* for each element $$x \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$, $$f_a(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$,
* the numbers generated by $$f_a$$ are distinct.

Since $$a \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}^*$$ and $$x \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$, then $$f_a(x) = ax ~\text{mod}~ n \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$ by the closure property. 

Suppose there are two distinct numbers $$x \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$ and $$y \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$ that $$f_a(x) = f_a(y)$$,

$$
\begin{array}{rlll}
f_a(x) &=& f_a(y) \\
ax ~\text{mod}~ n &=& ay ~\text{mod}~ n \\
(a ~\text{mod}~ n)(x ~\text{mod}~ n) &=& (a ~\text{mod}~ n)(y ~\text{mod}~ n) \\
(x ~\text{mod}~ n) &=& (y ~\text{mod}~ n) \\
x &\equiv& y & (\text{mod}~n)
\end{array}
$$
which contradicts the assumption, therefore the numbers generated by $$f_a$$ are distinct.
