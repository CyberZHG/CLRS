### 25-1 Transitive closure of a dynamic graph

> Suppose that we wish to maintain the transitive closure of a directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ as we insert edges into $$E$$. That is, after each edge has been inserted, we want to update the transitive closure of the edges inserted so far. Assume that the graph $$G$$ has no edges initially and that we represent the transitive closure as a boolean matrix.

> __*a*__. Show how to update the transitive closure $$G^* = (V, E^*)$$ of a graph $$G = (V, E)$$ in $$O(V^2)$$ time when a new edge is added to $$G$$.

Suppose the inverted edge is $$(u, v)$$, then if $$(a, u)$$ is true and $$(v, b)$$ is true, then $$(a, b)$$ is true.

> __*b*__. Give an example of a graph $$G$$ and an edge $$e$$ such that $$\Omega(V^2)$$ time is required to update the transitive closure after the insertion of $$e$$ into $$G$$, no matter what algorithm is used.

Two connected components.

> __*c*__. Describe an efficient algorithm for updating the transitive closure as edges are inserted into the graph. For any sequence of $$n$$ insertions, your algorithm should run in total time $$\sum_{i=1}^n t_i = O(V^3)$$, where $$t_i$$ is the time to update the transitive closure upon inserting the $$i$$th edge. Prove that your algorithm attains this time bound.

If $$(a, u)$$ is true, $$(a, v)$$ is not true and $$(v, b)$$ is true, then $$(a, b)$$ is true.

### 25-2 Shortest paths in $$\epsilon$$-dense graphs

> A graph $$G = (V, E)$$ is __*$$\epsilon$$-dense*__ if $$|E| = \Theta(V^{1 + \epsilon})$$ for some constant $$\epsilon$$ in the range $$0 < \epsilon \le 1$$. By using $$d$$-ary min-heaps (see Problem 6-2) in shortest-paths algorithms on $$\epsilon$$-dense graphs, we can match the running times of Fibonacci-heap-based algorithms without using as complicated a data structure.

> __*a*__. What are the asymptotic running times for INSERT, EXTRACT-MIN, and DECREASE-KEY, as a function of $$d$$ and the number $$n$$ of elements in a $$d$$-ary min-heap? What are these running times if we choose $$d = \Theta(n^\alpha)$$ for some constant $$0 < \alpha \le 1$$? Compare these running times to the amortized costs of these operations for a Fibonacci heap.

* INSERT: $$\Theta(\log_d n) = \Theta(1/\alpha)$$.
* EXTRACT-MIN: $$\Theta(d \log_d n) = \Theta(n^\alpha / \alpha)$$.
* DECREASE-KEY: $$\Theta(\log_d n) = \Theta(1/\alpha)$$.

> __*b*__. Show how to compute shortest paths from a single source on an $$\epsilon$$-dense directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ with no negative-weight edges in $$O(E)$$ time. (Hint: Pick $$d$$ as a function of $$\epsilon$$.)

Dijkstra, $$O(d \log_d V \cdot V + \log_d V \cdot E)$$, if $$d = V^\epsilon$$, then

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
& O(d \log_d V \cdot V + \log_d V \cdot E) \\
=& O(V^\epsilon \cdot V / \epsilon + E / \epsilon) \\
=& O((V^{1+\epsilon} + E) / \epsilon) \\
=& O((E + E) / \epsilon) \\
=& O(E)
\end{array}
$$

> __*c*__. Show how to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem on an $$\epsilon$$-dense directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ with no negative-weight edges in $$O(VE)$$ time. 

Run $$|V|$$ times Dijkstra, since the algorithm is $$O(E)$$ based on __*b*__, the total time is $$O(VE)$$.

> __*d*__. Show how to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem in $$O(VE)$$ time on an $$\epsilon$$-dense directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ that may have negative-weight edges but has no negative-weight cycles.

Johnson's reweight is $$O(VE)$$.
