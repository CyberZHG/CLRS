## 22.2 Breadth-first search

### 22.2-1

> Show the $$d$$ and $$\pi$$ values that result from running breadth-first search on the directed graph of Figure 22.2(a), using vertex 3 as the source.

| \ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| $$d$$ | $$\infty$$ | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| $$\pi$$ | NIL | 4 | NIL | 5 | 3 | 3 |

### 22.2-2

> Show the $$d$$ and $$\pi$$ values that result from running breadth-first search on the undirected graph of Figure 22.3, using vertex $$u$$ as the source.

| \ | $$r$$ | $$s$$ | $$t$$ | $$u$$ | $$v$$ | $$w$$ | $$x$$ | $$y$$ |

### 22.2-3

> Show that using a single bit to store each vertex color suffices by arguing that the BFS procedure would produce the same result if lines 5 and 14 were removed.

Duplicate.

### 22.2-4

> What is the running time of BFS if we represent its input graph by an adjacency matrix and modify the algorithm to handle this form of input?

$$\Theta(V^2)$$.

### 22.2-5

> Argue that in a breadth-first search, the value $$u.d$$ assigned to a vertex $$u$$ is independent of the order in which the vertices appear in each adjacency list. Using Figure 22.3 as an example, show that the breadth-first tree computed by BFS can depend on the ordering within adjacency lists.

$$\delta$$

### 22.2-6

> Give an example of a directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$, a source vertex $$s \in V$$, and a set of tree edges $$E_\pi \subseteq E$$ such that for each vertex $$v \in V$$, the unique simple path in the graph $$(V, E_\pi)$$ from $$s$$ to $$v$$ is a shortest path in $$G$$, yet the set of edges $$E_\pi$$ cannot be produced by running BFS on $$G$$, no matter how the vertices are ordered in each adjacency list.

### 22.2-7

> There are two types of professional wrestlers: "babyfaces" ("good guys") and "heels" ("bad guys"). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. Suppose we have $$n$$ professional wrestlers and we have a list of $$r$$ pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an $$O(n+r)$$-time algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a babyface and a heel. If it is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should produce it.

BFS, the new reachable node should have a different type. If the new node already have the same type with the current node, then it is impossible to perform such a designation.

### 22.2-8 $$\star$$

> The __*diameter*__ of a tree $$T = (V, E)$$ is defined as $$\max_{u,v \in V}\delta(u,v)$$, that is, the largest of all shortest-path distances in the tree. Give an efficient algorithm to compute the diameter of a tree, and analyze the running time of your algorithm.

BFS with a random node as the source, then BFS from the node with the largest $$\delta$$, the largest $$\delta$$ in the second BFS is the diameter of the tree, $$O(V + E)$$.

### 22.2-9

> Let $$G = (V, E)$$ be a connected, undirected graph. Give an $$O(V + E)$$-time algorithm to compute a path in $$G$$ that traverses each edge in $$E$$ exactly once in each direction. Describe how you can find your way out of a maze if you are given a large supply of pennies.

Eulerian path.
