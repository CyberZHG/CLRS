## 22.5 Strongly connected components

### 22.5-1

> How can the number of strongly connected components of a graph change if a new edge is added?

$$-(K - 1) \sim +1$$.

### 22.5-2

> Show how the procedure STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS works on the graph of Figure 22.6. Specifically, show the finishing times computed in line 1 and the forest produced in line 3. Assume that the loop of lines 5â€“7 of DFS considers vertices in alphabetical order and that the adjacency lists are in alphabetical order.

### 22.5-3

> Professor Bacon claims that the algorithm for strongly connected components would be simpler if it used the original (instead of the transpose) graph in the second depth-first search and scanned the vertices in order of _increasing_ finishing times. Does this simpler algorithm always produce correct results?

No.

### 22.5-4

> Prove that for any directed graph $$G$$, we have $$((G^T)^{SCC})^T = G^{SCC}$$. That is, the transpose of the component graph of $$G^T$$ is the same as the component graph of $$G$$.

$$u \leadsto v \overset{T}{\rightarrow} v \leadsto u$$.

### 22.5-5

> Give an $$O(V + E)$$-time algorithm to compute the component graph of a directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$. Make sure that there is at most one edge between two vertices in the component graph your algorithm produces.

Add edge $$(u', v')$$ if $$u \in C_{u'}$$, $$v \in C_{v'}$$ and there is an edge $$(u, v) \in E$$.

### 22.5-6

> Given a directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$, explain how to create another graph $$G' = (V, E')$$ such that (a) $$G'$$ has the same strongly connected components as $$G$$, (b) $$G'$$ has the same component graph as $$G$$, and (c) $$E'$$ is as small as possible. Describe a fast algorithm to compute $$G'$$.

Calculate SCCs, create a loop in each SCC, connect SCCs with one edge.

### 22.5-7 

> A directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ is __*semiconnected*__ if, for all pairs of vertices $$u, v \in V$$, we have $$u \leadsto v$$ or $$v \leadsto u$$. Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether or not $$G$$ is semiconnected. Prove that your algorithm is correct, and analyze its running time.

If $$\forall i \in [1, K)$$, there is an edge $$(u,v) \in E$$, $$u \in C_i$$, $$v \in C_{i+1}$$, then the graph is semiconnected, $$O(V + E)$$.
