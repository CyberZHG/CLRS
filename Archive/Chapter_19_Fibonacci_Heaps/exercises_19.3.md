## 19.3 Decreasing a key and deleting a node

### 19.3-1

> Suppose that a root $$x$$ in a Fibonacci heap is marked. Explain how $$x$$ came to be a marked root. Argue that it doesn't matter to the analysis that $$x$$ is marked, even though it is not a root that was first linked to another node and then lost one child.

### 19.3-2

> Justify the $$O(1)$$ amortized time of FIB-HEAP-DECREASE-KEY as an average cost per operation by using aggregate analysis.
