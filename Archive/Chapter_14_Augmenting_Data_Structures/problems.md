## Problems

### 14-1 Point of maximum overlap

> Suppose that we wish to  keep track of a point of maximum overlap in a set of intervals - a point with the largest number of intervals in the set that overlap it.

> __*a*__. Show that there will always be a point of maximum overlap that is an endpoint of one of the segments.

> __*b*__. Design a data structure that efficiently supports the operations INTERVAL-INSERT, INTERVAL-DELETE, and FIND-POM, which returns a point of maximum overlap.

### 14-2 Josephus permutation

> We define the __*Josephus problem*__ as follows. Suppose that $$n$$ people form a circle and that we are given a positive integer $$m \ge n$$. Beginning with a designated first person, we proceed around the circle, removing every $$m$$th person. After each person is removed, counting continues around the circle that remains. This process continues until we have removed all $$n$$ people. The order in which the people are removed from the circle defines the __*$$(n,m)$$-Josephus permutation*__ of the integers $$1,2, \dots ,n$$. For example, the $$(7, 3)$$-Josephus permutation is $$\langle 3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1, 4 \rangle$$.

> __*a*__. Suppose that $$m$$ is a constant. Describe an $$O(n)$$-time algorithm that, given an integer $$n$$, outputs the $$(n,m)$$-Josephus permutation.

Use doubly linked list, the time is $$O(nm)$$, since $$m$$ is a constant, $$O(nm)$$ = $$O(n)$$.

```python
class LinkedListNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert(self, key):
        x = LinkedListNode(key)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = x
            x.next = x
            x.prev = x
        else:
            x.prev = self.head.prev
            x.next = self.head
            x.prev.next = x
            x.next.prev = x

    def remove(self):
        if self.head.next == self.head:
            self.head = None
        else:
            self.head.next.prev = self.head.prev
            self.head.prev.next = self.head.next
            self.head = self.head.next

    def forward(self, step):
        while step > 0:
            step -= 1
            self.head = self.head.next

    lst = LinkedList()
    for i in xrange(1, n + 1):
        lst.insert(i)
    perm = []
    while lst.head is not None:
        lst.forward(m - 1)
        perm.append(lst.head.key)
        lst.remove()
    return perm

> __*b*__. Suppose that $$m$$ is not a constant. Describe an $$O(n \lg n)$$-time algorithm that, given integers $$n$$ and $$m$$, outputs the $$(n,m)$$-Josephus permutation.

Build a balanced binary search tree in $$O(n \lg n)$$, maintain $$size$$ to support order-statistics. In each iteration, we select and delete the $$(r + m - 1) ~\text{mod}~ T.root.size + 1$$th element.
