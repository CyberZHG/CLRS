## 3.1 Asymptotic notation

### 3.1-1

> Let $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$ be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of $$\Theta$$-notation, prove that $$\max(f(n), g(n)) = \Theta (f(n) + g(n))$$.

$$0.5 \cdot (f(n) + g(n)) \le \max(f(n), g(n)) \le 1 \cdot (f(n) + g(n))$$

### 3.1-2

> Show that for any real constants $$a$$ and $$b$$, where $$b>0$$, $$(n+a)^b=\Theta(n^b)$$.

If $$a > 0$$, then $$(n + a) ^ b < (n + n) ^ b = (2 n)^b = 2^b \cdot n^b$$;

If $$a < 0$$, let $$a := -a$$, then $$(n - a) ^ b > (n - 0.5n) ^ b = (0.5 n)^b = 0.5^b \cdot n^b$$,

Since $$0.5^b \cdot n^b \le (n+a)^b \le 2^b \cdot n^b$$, therefore $$(n+a)^b=\Theta(n^b)$$.

### 3.1-3

> Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm $$A$$ is at least $$O(n^2)$$," is meaningless.

$$O$$ is an upper bound, which means $$A$$ could be $$\Omega(1)$$.

### 3.1-4

> Is $$2^{n+1}=O(2^n)$$? Is $$2^{2n}=O(2^n)$$?

* $$2^{n+1}=O(2^n)$$?

$$1 \cdot 2^n \le 2^{n+1} \le 2 \cdot 2^n$$, thus $$2^{n+1}=O(2^n)$$.

* $$2^{2n}=O(2^n)$$?

$$2^{2n} \le c \cdot 2^n$$

$$2^n \le c$$ which is impossible, thus $$2^{2n} \ne O(2^n)$$.

### 3.1-5

> Prove Theorem 3.1.

> Theorem 3.1
>
> For any two function $$f(n)$$ and $$g(n)$$, we have $$f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$$ if and only if $$f(n)=O(g(n))$$ and $$f(n)=\Omega(g(n))$$.

$$f(n)=O(g(n))$$ implies $$0 \le f(n) \le c_2 g(n)$$

$$f(n)=\Omega(g(n))$$ implies $$0 \le c_1 g(n) \le f(n)$$

Thus $$c_1 g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2 g(n)$$, $$f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$$, and vice versa.

### 3.1-6

> Prove that the running time of an algorithm is $$\Theta(g(n))$$ if and only if its worst-case running time is $$O(g(n))$$ and its best-case running time is $$\Omega(g(n))$$.

Theorem 3.1

### 3.1-7

> Prove that $$o(g(n)) \cap \omega(g(n))$$ is the empty set.

There is no $$f(n)$$ that $$f(n) < g(n)$$ and $$f(n) > g(n)$$.

### 3.1-8

> We can extend our notation to the case of two parameters $$n$$ and $$m$$ that can go to infinity independently at different rates. For a given function $$g(n,m)$$, we denote by $$O(g(n,m))$$ the set of functions
>
> $$O(g(n,m))=\{f(n,m)$$: there exist positive constants $$c$$, $$n_0$$, and $$m_0$$ such that $$0 \le f(n,m) \le c g(n,m)$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$ or $$m \ge m_0$$ $$\}$$.
>
> Give corresponding definitions for $$\Omega(g(n,m))$$ and $$\Theta(g(n,m))$$.


$$\Omega(g(n,m))=\{f(n,m)$$: there exist positive constants $$c$$, $$n_0$$, and $$m_0$$ such that $$0 \le c g(n,m) \le f(n,m)$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$ or $$m \ge m_0$$ $$\}$$.

$$\Theta(g(n,m))=\{f(n,m)$$: there exist positive constants $$c_1$$, $$c_2$$, $$n_0$$, and $$m_0$$ such that $$c_1 g(n,m) \le f(n,m) \le c_2 g(n,m)$$ for all $$n \ge n_0$$ or $$m \ge m_0$$ $$\}$$.
