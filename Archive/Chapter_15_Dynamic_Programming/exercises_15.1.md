## 15.1 Rod cutting

### 15.1-1

> Show that equation (15.4) follows from equation (15.3) and the initial condition $$T(0) = 1$$.

For $$n=0$$, $$T(0) = 2^0 = 1$$.

Suppose $$T(i) = 2^i$$ for $$i$$ in $$[0, n - 1]$$, then
$$
T(n) = 1 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} T(j) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1 + 1 = 2^n
$$
### 15.1-2

> Show, by means of a counterexample, that the following "greedy" strategy does not always determine an optimal way to cut rods. Define the density of a rod of length $$i$$ to be $$p_i/i$$, that is, its value per inch. The greedy strategy for a rod of length $$n$$ cuts off a first piece of length $$i$$, where $$1 \le i \le n$$, having maximum density. It then continues by applying the greedy strategy to the remaining piece of length $$n - i$$ .

Suppose $$p_1  = 1, p_2 = 8, p_3 = 14, p_4 = 0$$, the densities $$p_1 / 1 = 1, p_2 / 4 = 2, p_3 / 3 = 4 \frac{2}{3}$$, for $$n=4$$, the greedy result is $$3$$ and $$1$$, the total value if $$15$$, and the dynamic programming solution is $$2$$ and $$2$$, which is $$16$$.

### 15.1-3

> Consider a modification of the rod-cutting problem in which, in addition to a price $$p_i$$ for each rod, each cut incurs a fixed cost of $$c$$. The revenue associated with a solution is now the sum of the prices of the pieces minus the costs of making the cuts. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to solve this modified problem.

$$r_n = \max(\max_{1 \le i \le {n - 1}} (p_i + r_{n-i}) - c, p_n)$$

```python
def cut_rod(p, n, c):
    r = [0 for _ in xrange(n + 1)]
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        r[j] = p[j]
        for i in range(1, j):
            r[j] = max(r[j], p[i] + r[j - i] - c)
    return r[n]
```

### 15.1-4

> Modify MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD to return not only the value but the actual solution, too.

```python
def cut_rod_sub(p, n, r, s):
    if r[n] >= 0:
        return r[n]
    r[n] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ret = p[i] + cut_rod_sub(p, n - i, r, s)
        if r[n] < ret:
            r[n] = ret
            s[n] = i
    return r[n]


def cut_rod(p, n):
    r = [-1 for _ in xrange(n + 1)]
    s = [i for i in xrange(n + 1)]
    cut_rod_sub(p, n, r, s)
    r = r[n]
    subs = []
    while n > 0:
        subs.append(s[n])
        n -= s[n]
    return r, subs
```

### 15.1-5

> The Fibonacci numbers are defined by recurrence (3.22). Give an $$O(n)$$-time dynamic-programming algorithm to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Draw the subproblem graph. How many vertices and edges are in the graph?

```python
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        c = a + b
        a, b = b, c
    return c
