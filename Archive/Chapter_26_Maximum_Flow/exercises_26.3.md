## 26.3 Maximum bipartite matching

### 26.3-1

> Run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on the flow network in Figure 26.8(c) and show the residual network after each flow augmentation. Number the vertices in $$L$$ top to bottom from 1 to 5 and in $$R$$ top to bottom from 6 to 9. For each iteration, pick the augmenting path that is lexicographically smallest.

### 26.3-2

> Prove Theorem 26.10.

### 26.3-3

> Let $$G = (V, E)$$ be a bipartite graph with vertex partition $$V = L \cup R$$, and let $$G'$$ be its corresponding flow network. Give a good upper bound on the length of any augmenting path found in $$G'$$ during the execution of FORD-FULKERSON.

### 26.3-4 $$\star$$

> A __*perfect matching*__ is a matching in which every vertex is matched. Let $$G = (V, E)$$ be an undirected bipartite graph with vertex partition $$V = L \cup R$$, where $$|L| = |R|$$. For any $$X \subseteq V$$, define the __*neighborhood*__ of $$X$$ as
> 
> $$N(X) = \{ y \in V: (x, y) \in E ~\text{for some}~ x \in X \}$$,
> 
> that is, the set of vertices adjacent to some member of $$X$$. Prove __*Hall's theorem*__: there exists a perfect matching in $$G$$ if and only if $$|A| \le |N(A)|$$ for every subset $$A \subseteq L$$.

### 26.3-5 $$\star$$

> We say that a bipartite graph $$G = (V, E)$$, where $$V = L \cup R$$, is __*d-regular*__ if every vertex $$v \in V$$ has degree exactly $$d$$. Every $$d$$-regular bipartite graph has $$|L| = |R|$$. Prove that every $$d$$-regular bipartite graph has a matching of cardinality $$|L|$$ by arguing that a minimum cut of the corresponding flow network has capacity $$|L|$$.
