## 26.4 Push-relabel algorithms

### 26.4-1

> Prove that, after the procedure INITIALIZE-PREFLOW$$(G, S)$$ terminates, we have $$s.e \le -|f^*|$$, where $$f^*$$ is a maximum flow for $$G$$.

### 26.4-2

> Show how to implement the generic push-relabel algorithm using $$O(V)$$ time per relabel operation, $$O(1)$$ time per push, and $$O(1)$$ time to select an applicable operation, for a total time of $$O(V^2E)$$.

### 26.4-3

> Prove that the generic push-relabel algorithm spends a total of only $$O(VE)$$ time in performing all the $$O(V^2)$$ relabel operations.

### 26.4-4

> Suppose that we have found a maximum flow in a flow network $$G = (V, E)$$ using a push-relabel algorithm. Give a fast algorithm to find a minimum cut in $$G$$.

### 26.4-5

> Give an efficient push-relabel algorithm to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. Analyze your algorithm.

### 26.4-6

> Suppose that all edge capacities in a flow network $$G = (V, E)$$ are in the set $$\{ 1, 2, \dots, k \}$$. Analyze the running time of the generic push-relabel algorithm in terms of $$|V|$$, $$|E|$$, and $$k$$. (Hint: How many times can each edge support a nonsaturating push before it becomes saturated?)

### 26.4-7

> Show that we could change line 6 of INITIALIZE-PREFLOW to 
> 
> `6  s.h = |G.V| - 2` 
> 
> without affecting the correctness or asymptotic performance of the generic pushrelabel algorithm.

### 26.4-8

> Let $$\delta_f(u, v)$$ be the distance (number of edges) from $$u$$ to $$v$$ in the residual network $$G_f$$. Show that the GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL procedure maintains the properties that $$u.h < |V|$$ implies $$u.h \le \delta_f(u, t)$$ and that $$u.h \ge |V|$$ implies $$u.h - |V| \le \delta_f(u, s)$$.

### 26.4-9 $$\star$$

> As in the previous exercise, let $$\delta_f(u, v)$$ be the distance from $$u$$ to $$v$$ in the residual network $$G_f$$. Show how to modify the generic push-relabel algorithm to maintain the property that $$u.h < |V|$$ implies $$u.h = \delta_f(u, t)$$ and that $$u.h \ge |V|$$ implies $$u.h - |V| = \delta_f(u, s)$$. The total time that your implementation dedicates to maintaining this property should be $$O(VE)$$.

### 26.4-10

> Show that the number of nonsaturating pushes executed by the GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL procedure on a flow network $$G = (V, E)$$ is at most $$4|V|^2|E|$$ for $$|V| \ge 4$$.
