## 26.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method

### 26.2-1

> Prove that the summations in equation (26.6) equal the summations in equation (26.7).

$$\sum_{v \in V_2} f(s, v) = 0$$, $$\sum_{v \in V_1} f(v, s)$$.

### 26.2-2

> In Figure 26.1(b), what is the flow across the cut $$(\{s, v_2, v_4\}, \{v_1, v_3, t\})$$? What is the capacity of this cut?

$$f(S, T) = f(s, v_1) + f(v_2, v_1) + f(v_4, v_3) + f(v_4, t) - f(v_3, v_2) = 11 + 1 + 7 + 4 - 4 = 19$$.

$$c(S, T) = c(s, v_1) + c(v_2, v_1) + c(v_4, v_3) + c(v_4, t) = 16 + 4 + 7 + 4 = 31$$.

### 26.2-3

> Show the execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm on the flow network of Figure 26.1(a).

### 26.2-4

> In the example of Figure 26.6, what is the minimum cut corresponding to the maximum flow shown? Of the augmenting paths appearing in the example, which one cancels flow?

### 26.2-5

> Recall that the construction in Section 26.1 that converts a flow network with multiple sources and sinks into a single-source, single-sink network adds edges with infinite capacity. Prove that any flow in the resulting network has a finite value if the edges of the original network with multiple sources and sinks have finite capacity.

Flow in equals flow out.

### 26.2-6

> Suppose that each source $$s_i$$ in a flow network with multiple sources and sinks produces exactly $$p_i$$ units of flow, so that $$\sum_{v \in V} f(s_i, v) = p_i$$. Suppose also that each sink $$t_j$$ consumes exactly $$q_j$$ units, so that $$\sum_{v \in V} f(v, t_j) = q_j$$, where $$\sum_i p_i = \sum_j q_j$$. Show how to convert the problem of finding a flow $$f$$ that obeys these additional constraints into the problem of finding a maximum flow in a single-source, single-sink flow network.

$$c(s, s_i) = p_i$$, $$c(t_j, t) = q_j$$.

### 26.2-7

> Prove Lemma 26.2.

### 26.2-8

> Suppose that we redefine the residual network to disallow edges into $$s$$. Argue that the procedure FORD-FULKERSON still correctly computes a maximum flow.

Correct.

### 26.2-9

> Suppose that both $$f$$ and $$f'$$ are flows in a network $$G$$ and we compute flow $$f \uparrow f'$$. Does the augmented flow satisfy the flow conservation property? Does it satisfy the capacity constraint?

It satisfies the flow conservation property and doesn't satisfy the capacity constraint.

### 26.2-10

> Show how to find a maximum flow in a network $$G = (V, E)$$ by a sequence of at most $$|E|$$ augmenting paths. (Hint: Determine the paths after finding the maximum flow.)

Find the minimum cut.

### 26.2-11

> The __*edge connectivity*__ of an undirected graph is the minimum number $$k$$ of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. For example, the edge connectivity of a tree is 1, and the edge connectivity of a cyclic chain of vertices is 2. Show how to determine the edge connectivity of an undirected graph $$G = (V, E)$$ by running a maximum-flow algorithm on at most $$|V|$$ flow networks, each having $$O(V)$$ vertices and $$O(E)$$ edges.

Use each $$v$$ as the source, find the minimum minimum cut.

### 26.2-12

> Suppose that you are given a flow network $$G$$, and $$G$$ has edges entering the source $$s$$. Let $$f$$ be a flow in $$G$$ in which one of the edges $$(v, s)$$ entering the source has $$f(v, s) = 1$$. Prove that there must exist another flow $$f'$$ with $$f'(v, s) = 0$$ such that $$|f|=|f'|$$. Give an $$O(E)$$-time algorithm to compute $$f'$$, given $$f$$, and assuming that all edge capacities are integers.

### 26.2-13

> Suppose that you wish to find, among all minimum cuts in a flow network $$G$$ with integral capacities, one that contains the smallest number of edges. Show how to modify the capacities of $$G$$ to create a new flow network $$G'$$ in which any minimum cut in $$G'$$ is a minimum cut with the smallest number of edges in $$G$$.
