Suppose that list $L_i$ has $q_i$ inversions after processing the access sequence $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots, \\sigma_i \\rangle$. Then, we define a potential function $\\Phi$ that maps $L_i$ to a real number by $\\Phi(L_i) = 2q_i$. For example, if $L_i$ has the elements $\\langle e, c, a, d, b \\rangle$ and $L_i^*$ has the elements $\\langle c, a, b, d, e \\rangle$, then $L_i$ has 5 inversions $((e, c), (e, a), (e, d), (e, b), (d, b))$, and so $\\Phi(L_i) = 10$. Observe that $\\Phi(L_i) \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and that, if move-to-front and heuristic $\\text{H}$ start with the same list $L_0$, then $\\Phi(L_0) = 0$.\n",
