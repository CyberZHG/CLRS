    "### 2-1 Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although merge sort runs in $\\Theta(n \\lg n)$ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to __coarsen__ the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which $n=k$ sublists of length $k$ are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where $k$ is a value to be determined."
