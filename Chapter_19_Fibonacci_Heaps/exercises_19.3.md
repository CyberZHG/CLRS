### 19.3-1

> Suppose that a root $x$ in a Fibonacci heap is marked. Explain how $x$ came to be a marked root. Argue that it doesn't matter to the analysis that $x$ is marked, even though it is not a root that was first linked to another node and then lost one child.

### 19.3-2

> Justify the $O(1)$ amortized time of FIB-HEAP-DECREASE-KEY as an average cost per operation by using aggregate analysis.
